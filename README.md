## Overview

Use two LDR sensors to detect light imbalance and adjust a servo to keep a solar panel aligned with the strongest light source.

## Code Explained

- Reads left/right LDRs on `A0/A1` and computes their difference.
- Steps the servo left or right to reduce imbalance.
- Prints alignment status messages.

## How To Use

- Place LDRs on either side of the panel with shades to increase directionality.
- Connect the servo to `D9` and power it appropriately.
- Tune thresholds and step size for smooth tracking.
